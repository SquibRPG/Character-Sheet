## Data & IP / Takedown Risk Notes (PLEASE READ)
This project is intended as a **fan-made tabletop character sheet UI**. To reduce takedown risk:

### Non-affiliation
This project is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by** Nintendo, Game Freak, The Pokémon Company, or any related entities.

### Trademarks
“Pokémon” and related marks are trademarks of their respective owners.  
Use of the term “Pokémon” here is **referential only**.

### Content policy (recommended)
To minimize risk, this repo should **avoid including copyrighted text** or proprietary game content (e.g., full move descriptions, ability descriptions, Pokédex entries, official art, logos, sprites, or scans).

**Best practice:** ship one of these options:
- **Option 1 (lowest risk):** empty JSON templates + user fills their own data
- **Option 2:** a small, original “demo dataset” with **original names/descriptions** (no official text)
- **Option 3 (higher risk):** only names/IDs with no official descriptions/art, and require users to add any descriptive text themselves

If you keep official names in datasets, that is generally lower risk than distributing full official text/art, but it can still draw attention depending on scope and usage.

### No official assets
Do **not** include:
- official artwork, sprites, logos
- official move/ability descriptions
- official Pokédex text
- copyrighted rulebook text

### No commercial intent
This project is intended for **personal tabletop use**. Do not sell it, bundle it with paid content, or gate features behind payment.

## Export / Import
- **Export:** downloads a single JSON file containing your current sheet state.
- **Import:** loads that file back into the sheet.

Tip: exports can be shared between devices, but they may contain personal notes.

---

## Security / Privacy
- Data is stored locally in your browser.
- Nothing is sent to a server (unless you host it yourself somewhere and modify it).
- Treat exported JSON like a save file—don’t share it if it contains private notes.

---

## License
**Code:** choose a permissive license (MIT recommended).  
**Data:** ensure any included dataset is original or licensed for redistribution.

> If you intend to distribute large datasets that mirror official content, consider removing them from the repo and providing templates instead.
